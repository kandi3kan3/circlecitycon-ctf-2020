Lockdown is clearly referring to Zinnias (https://bloominghillva.blogspot.com/2010/08/zinnia-cindrella-of-garden.html, https://wiki.xn--rckteqa2e.com/wiki/%E3%83%92%E3%82%AC%E3%83%8A, https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zinnia), and there are 5400 seeds at the Svalbard seed vault at 78N, 15E (https://www.nordgen.org/sgsv/index.php?app=data_unit&unit=sgsv_by_genus&unit_id=2721556).

The whole number 5400 for the Zinnia genus doesn't work, so I had to try
all of the records individually. 500 seemed to be accepted.

Downloading the entire database `sgsv_templates_20200613.tab` from
https://www.nordgen.org/sgsv/download.php?file=/scope/sgsv/files/sgsv_templates.tab ,
the first record for a Zinnia has 500 seeds, so I'm wondering if the
author of the challenge didn't sum all of them up?
