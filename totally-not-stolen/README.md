Since we're no longer able to play in a conference hotel, we figured we
could bring the hotel to you. Here are two hotel keys that we totally
borrowed and dumped for you. We believe that you should be able to compare
the check in, check out, and room number associated with each key.

On the first key, we can tell you that the owner:

- [1] checked into their room @ 12:02 on June 8, 2019
- [1] checked out @ 11:00 on June 15, 2019

What was the room number and check-in time for time for the second key?
Make sure to setup the correct flag format and answer the question in this
style: `RoomNumber+MM-DD-YY_HH:MM`
