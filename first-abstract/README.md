Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality.
To approach the spiritual in art, one will make as little use as possible
of reality, because reality is opposed to the spiritual. We find ourselves
in the presence of an abstract art. Art should be above reality, otherwise
it would have no value for man.
