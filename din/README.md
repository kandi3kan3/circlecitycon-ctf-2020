This one was significantly more difficult for me than [rock-lobster].
We get an image that looks like it's in another alphabet:

![din](./din.png)

I tried to reverse-image search both the full image and a single cropped
character, but got no results, unfortunately:

![one character](./one.png)

I wish there was anything interesting to say, but I basically just
searched Google Images for "fictional alphabets" until I found something
that looked right.

I found a Star Wars alphabet with a similar-looking "A" character that
led me to the Mandalorian alphabet:

![Mandalorian alphabet](./mandalorian.webp)

Translating with this alphabet was fairly easy, given the repeating
characters at the end:

`CCC{BABY YO DA DA DADA DADA}`
